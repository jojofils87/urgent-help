# urgent-help
I am making an App with GlideApp. I want to set up an upgrade/subscriber fee that will allow the subscriber access to a locked content but I don't know how to do so. Plus among the locked content I want to establish a direct communication(message, chat) between the provider and the client but I don't know how to set it up
